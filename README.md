# Byte
Byte is “the Tinder for food” for those who have trouble deciding where to go eat. Users will be shown cards with local restaurants and they can swipe/select √ or X. Afterwards, users can see where they have matched with their friends and given the necessary information to make reservations, directions, etc.

# Motivation:
When we started brainstorming ideas for Project 3, we seemed to have food as a common motivator and decided to go with that idea. While discussing where we like to eat, we had the idea to build something that would help us choose a place that most people in a group could agree upon.

# Purpose:
Byte is for people who want to go out to eat but have trouble making decisions. With a simple Yes/No for each person in the group, Byte will show the places people agree on (by perfect match, tie, or by rank).
