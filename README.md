# Byte
A web application that answers the question-what are we going to eat? Byte is “the Tinder for food.” Users will be shown cards with local restaurants and they can swipe/select √ or X. Afterwards, users can see where they have matched with their friends so it’ll help them decide where to eat. 

# Motivation:

# Purpose:
Byte is for people who want to go out to eat but have trouble making decisions. With a simple Yes/No for each person in the group, Byte will show the places people agree on (perfect match, tie, or by rank).
